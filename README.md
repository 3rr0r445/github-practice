This is a basic introductory repo to practice using github and my cursor IDE.
It's going well so far, I'm just going to add files and work on commit messages and pushing to main.
I'll inevitably work on branching and forking but for now, I'm just trying to learn the terminal commands.
I could use the IDE to do it but I want to know how to use the terminal better as well.
We will get there, I'm sure.
